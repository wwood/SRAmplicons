      <h2>Philosophy</h2>
      <p>The recent rise in next-generation sequencing has resulted in a large numbers of 16S amplicon sequences being
      generated. Unfortunately while many more sequences are being generated, the newly generated sequences
      are relatively short.
      This makes it increasinlgy difficult to ask a basic question in microbial ecology:</p>
      <blockquote>
      <p>Where has humanity encountered this lineage before?</p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>While SRAmplicons cannot account for all of humanity, it is able to provide an incomplete answer.
      Using the <%= link_to 'SRAdb', 'http://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/SRAdb.html' %> to
      screen the SRA for 16S pyrosequencing datasets, <%= Cluster.select('distinct(sra_run_id)').count %> datasets
      were error-corrected, OTU clustered, assigned taxonomy and transformed into this web-accessible resource.

      <h2>Usage</h2>
      <p>There are several ways to find studies that have previously observed particular lineages:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><%= link_to 'Search', search_url %> by taxonomy</li>
        <li><%= link_to 'Search', search_url %> by prokMSA identifier</li>
        <li>BLAST search against clustered OTUs (coming soon)</li>
        <li>Download flat-files (coming soon)</li>
      </ul>
